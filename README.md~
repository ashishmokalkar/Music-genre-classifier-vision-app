# Music Genre Classification using Spectrogram and MEL Spectrogram images

## CODE REQUIREMENTS:

**pip install requirements.txt**

## DESCRIPTION:

**This project repository detects the genre of an audio song by plotting its spectrogram and MEL spectrogram diagram. The system is trained to classify 3 types of genres - POP, ROCK and JAZZ. The system can be easily extended to other genres like EDM, metal etc. by training a model on their data.**

## IMPLEMENTATION:

**-Python 3.6**

**-Pytorch (Deep Learning)**

**-Librosa (Python audio Processing Library)**

**-Convolutional Neural Networks**

##Technique:

**Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition.

##Model Used:

**ResNet-50(Residual Network)**

This repo can be used as a starting point to deploy [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) models on Render.

The sample app described here is up at https://fastai-v3.onrender.com. Test it out with bear images!

You can test your changes locally by installing Docker and using the following command:

```
docker build -t fastai-v3 . && docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 fastai-v3
```

The guide for production deployment to Render is at https://course.fast.ai/deployment_render.html.
